# bamazon

Welcome to bamazon! 

This application mimics an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL The app takes in orders (on the Command Line) from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. 

When typing node bamazon.js, the application will prompt you to select a item from the store. It will then ask you how many quanities you'd like to purchase. The system will then calculates the cost of the items and deducts it from the inventory. If there aren't enough quanities of an item, the store will let you know!

Enjoy!
